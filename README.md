## What is DevOps?
DevOps is the collaboration of software development and operations, automating and integrating these two sectors, as a means to improve and streamline the software development life cycle.

## Why DevOps?
Previously development teams and operations teams worked seperately and there was not much collaboration. Deployment environments can vary from development to production so errors can occur. With operations similar errors occured when deploying, as well as lack of communication and collaboration in turn led to less frequent delivery of software. This is where DevOps cultures comes in; companies that adopt DevOps practices and tools gain a competitive advantage that is very significant where:

- Products are built faster
- There is greater customer satisfaction and user experience
- Collaboration and productivity are improved <img style="float: left;" src=https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/129324316/231521849-81896727-35a9-4055-8d39-03469b1814e5.png>


### Technical Benefits of DevOps
- Automated scalable environments
- Continuous release cycles
- Continuous software delivery
- Faster resolution of problems
- Higher confidence in releases

### Business Benefits of DevOps
- Faster time to market
- Increase quality of software due to automated testing


### Cultural Benefits of DevOps
- Improved Team Collaboration
- Happier, more productive teams
- Higher employee engagement

## DevOps Role

- Delivering high quality software frequently and fast
- Implementing automation supported by the **CI/CD** pipeline
- Monitoring DevOps pipeline and application 
- Ensure software is up to date

## What is Cloud Computing and AWS?
Cloud computing is the delivery of resources over the internet "cloud" as developers referred to it. Instead of storing data in hardware, such as data centers and servers, cloud computing provides this service to companies. AWS(Amazon Web Services) is an example of a cloud provider.

## How does it fit into DevOps?
- Cloud computing is agile: DevOps teams can curate many cloud environments in minutes, and shut them down when no longer needed, instead of having to maintain physical IT infrastructures which would take more time. As well as manage access between teams allowing for collaboration in DevOps.
- DevOps Automation: DevOps uses cloud systems such as Kubernetes where apps can be continuously integrated and deployed as well as monitored automatically.
- Serverless Computing: DevOps are able to build, deploy and operate serverless apps, using **Infrastructure as Code** (IaC) the process of building infrastructure can be automated instead o fbeing done physically, and can be changed respectively.

## Benefits of Cloud Computing  
- Cloud computing allows companies to manage data without the hassle and maintenance of building a physical IT infrastructure such as Data Centers
- Data Loss Prevention
- Allows quick response to change during periods of disruption
- Reduced carbon footprint
- Cost Effective

## Companies that have moved to the cloud 
- Netflix:
Netflix turned to cloud in order to scale their services due to the spike in demand, now they produce their own movies, and have made a major comeback since their crash in 2008.
- Instagram 
Similar to Netflix, Instagram turned to cloud computing in order to scale the app, where their servers were overwhelmed- they had 3 million users 3 months shortly after they turned to the cloud.
- Etsy
Cost-effective analytics is by far one of the most alluring features of cloud computing. Etsy turned to big data solutions to help with its predictive analytics, such as the siteâ€™s Taste Test feature which helps determine which products are the right fit for a particular customer.
